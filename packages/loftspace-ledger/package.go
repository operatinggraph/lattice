// Package loftspaceledger is the Loftspace tenant payment ledger: a per-lease
// financial account that records charges (rent, fees, deposits) and payments
// as an append-only transaction history, never a mutable running total.
//
// It declares:
//
//   - The `account` vertex type (DDL `account`) — CreateAccount mints
//     vtx.account.<NanoID> (root data {} per D5) with its OWN
//     independently-minted NanoID (never reused from the lease — Core KV
//     NanoIDs are unique platform-wide identifiers, not scoped per vertex
//     type), linked to the leaseapp via heldFor. "At most one account per
//     lease" is enforced by the `ledgerAccountGuard` aspect on the leaseapp
//     instead of a shared/derived key.
//
//   - The `ledgerAccountGuard` aspect type (DDL `ledgerAccountGuard`) —
//     vtx.leaseapp.<NanoID>.ledgerAccount = {accountKey}, written once by
//     CreateAccount alongside the account it names; its deterministic,
//     lease-anchored key is the uniqueness guard.
//
//   - The `transaction` vertex type (DDL `transaction`) — DebitAccount (a
//     charge: rent, a late fee, a deposit) and CreditAccount (a payment
//     received) each mint vtx.transaction.<NanoID> (root data {} per D5) with a
//     .entry aspect {type, amountCents, memo?, postedAt}, linked to the account
//     via postedTo. The ledger is append-only: a balance is derived by summing
//     entries (the ledgerHistory lens), never stored as a mutable aspect — so
//     concurrent debits/credits never race a read-modify-write. DebitAccount's
//     optional clauseRef additionally writes the authorizedBy link (transaction
//     → clause) and updates the clause's .status — completed for a one-time
//     clause, or chargeValidUntil re-armed for a period="monthly" clause
//     (Fire V3) — the semantic-contracts Executable Paper package's canonical
//     directOp consumer.
//
//   - The `ledgerHistory` lens (§10.2-style read model, one row per
//     transaction) the payment-history FE reads (P5).
//
//   - The `leaseAccounts` lens (one row per lease, accountKey null until one
//     is opened) — the FE's only way to resolve a lease's account key, since
//     it can no longer be derived from leaseAppKey.
//
// This is the ledger the semantic-contracts-executable-paper design builds to:
// vtx.account.<id> + Debit/CreditAccount + ledger entries linked back to
// their authorizing source (packages/semantic-contracts, Fire V1).
//
// Mirrors packages/clinic-ledger, with the account held for a lease instead
// of a patient (see implementation-artifacts/adjacency-shared-nanoid-collision-design.md
// for why the account carries its own independent NanoID rather than the
// lease's).
//
// Depends lease-signing (the leaseapp vertex type an account is heldFor).
