# Edge showcase app ("Facet") — the discovery-driven personal client — design

**Status: ✅ RATIFIED (Andrew, 2026-07-11) — "Approved, add to the backlog."** Blanket approval; the four forks stand at their RECOMMENDED options (FORK-1 B, FORK-2 A, FORK-3 A, FORK-4 A), rewritten as DECIDED below with the roads not taken — flag any single fork to override. No frozen-contract change. **Build runs through the fleet, not this session:** platform fires 0/1/4 → Lattice lane, app fires 2/3/5 → Verticals lane. Author: Winston (lead) · Designer fire 2026-07-10, ratified 2026-07-11.
**Backlog rows:** [verticals.md](../planning-artifacts/backlog/verticals.md) → *Edge showcase app (Facet)* (app fires 2/3/5) · [lattice.md](../planning-artifacts/backlog/lattice.md) → *Edge & personal lenses* → *Edge-manifest + personal-lens consumer* (platform fires 0/1/4).
**Consumers:** this app is the named consumer that un-defers **PL.6** (WebSocket/push bridge) and **EDGE.5** (browser/mobile node), and the demand driver for the per-actor write-surface migration. *(Both since un-deferred for real: EDGE.5 ratified 2026-07-16 with its own fire plan — [edge-browser-node-design.md](edge-browser-node-design.md), W1–W4, all-lattice single-lane; it subsumes Fire 4 below and corrects FORK-2's mechanism.)*
**Contracts:** build-to #1, #2 (§2.5 read posture), #6 (§6.5 service path, §6.10 availability, §6.14 read grants), #9 (claim), #10 (§10.1 tasks, §10.5, §10.7 auto-complete), #11 (external actor authn). **Frozen-contract change: NONE** (see FORK-1 — the descriptor vocabulary ships as a component spec, not a contract edit).

## For Andrew (one-look ratification block)

**What it does (two lines).** A personal client (PWA first, iOS later) whose only hardcoded behavior is *authenticate against the deployment IdP and connect*; everything else — which services exist for this identity, which operations they permit, what forms they need, which tasks await — arrives as **data** over the already-shipped Personal Lens, projected by a new `edge-manifest` package and rendered by a fixed, service-agnostic widget vocabulary. A new service wired `availableAt` the user's building appears in the app with **zero app change**.

**The one thing to understand before ratifying.** This design adds *no new planes and relaxes no invariant*: reads are lens projections delivered over the shipped per-identity SYNC stream (P5), writes are ordinary operations through the shipped Gateway door (P2), authorization stays step-3 capability checks — the manifest only makes *visibility* honest, never *permission*. The app is a pure function of its local mirror.

**Frozen-contract change: NONE.**

**FORK-1 — where the descriptor vocabulary lives. DECIDED: B (Andrew, 2026-07-11).** Ship it as `docs/components/edge-manifest.md` (build-to spec, versioned `vocab: 1`); freeze as a contract when the **second renderer** (iOS/SwiftUI, Fire 5) proves client-neutrality — the freeze trigger is named, not open-ended.
- *Road not taken — A:* freeze now as a new Contract #12. Rejected for v1: freezing v0 guesses before a second renderer exists invites amendment churn.

**FORK-2 — the browser engine. DECIDED: A (Andrew, 2026-07-11) — mechanism corrected by the ratified EDGE.5 design (FORK-W A′, Andrew, 2026-07-16).** A's intent stands: one engine, LWW/overlay/queue semantics single-sourced in Go/wasm, store → IndexedDB. A's "transport → WebSocket" half was falsified by vendor grounding — **`nats.go` has no js/wasm/browser transport** (raw TCP dials; upstream requests open since 2021; the vendor's browser client is `nats.js`). As ratified in [edge-browser-node-design.md](edge-browser-node-design.md), the engine splits at a **transport seam**: wasm semantics core + a thin JS transport shell (WS connect, durable consume, control RPCs) over vendored `nats.js`. Executes as EDGE.5 fires W1–W4.
- *Road not taken — B:* the protocol-parity TypeScript mini-engine stays the **pre-approved tripwire fallback** (EDGE.5's named tripwire: >~2× the measured 1.3 MB-gz baseline, or the JS↔wasm bridge proves unworkable). *C (REST-only thin client):* rejected — a second read plane that abandons the offline-first store.

**FORK-3 — manifest transport. DECIDED: A (Andrew, 2026-07-11).** Personal Lens only: the manifest is a set of `nats_subject` personal lenses; the app's world-feed is the SYNC stream + hydration, exactly as EDGE.1/2 consume it.
- *Road not taken — B:* add a Gateway REST snapshot (`GET /v1/manifest`, RLS-backed) as a cold-start/degraded fallback — a compatible later extension, not v1. *C (REST-primary):* rejected (same second-plane smell as FORK-2 C).

**FORK-4 — first target platform. DECIDED: A (Andrew, 2026-07-11).** Browser/PWA first: App Store guideline 2.5.2 does not apply to the PWA route (edge design §6 addendum); NATS WebSocket is native to our pinned server (§5); one link demos anywhere including phones; iOS/SwiftUI follows as the second renderer that triggers the FORK-1 freeze.
- *Road not taken — B:* native iOS first — better device story (push, biometrics) but pays TestFlight friction + the 2.5.2 open item immediately, and delays the two-renderer proof.

## 1. The thesis — discover, don't hardcode

Every existing vertical FE hardcodes its world: routes, bucket names, `operationType` strings, per-op form fields, even client-side reconstruction of 6-segment link keys for `reads` declarations (`cmd/loftspace-app/web/app.js` — 16 hardcoded op call sites and a hand-authored `COMPLETIONS` form registry). The codebase itself names the way out, in the comment at `app.js:76`: *"the generic DDL-self-describing form needs an op-catalog read model — a Core-KV op-meta scan would violate P5 in a vertical app."*

Facet inverts the posture. Its **entire hardcoded surface** is:

1. an OIDC client flow (IdP discovery URL, client id — deployment config),
2. two base URLs (Gateway for writes/whoami; sync endpoint for the Personal Lens),
3. the **descriptor vocabulary interpreter** — a fixed set of widgets and screen archetypes that render whatever vocabulary-conformant rows appear in the local mirror.

Everything a user can *see* is a manifest row that arrived over their personal delta stream; everything they can *do* is an operation descriptor that arrived the same way. The identity's graph relationships — `residesIn` a unit contained in a building where a laundry service is `availableAt`, a task `assignedTo` them, a role they hold — are the *only* source of the UI. Same binary, different identity ⇒ different app.

This is the vault's original Edge vision made concrete ("traversing the local graph… tells the frontend which UI components to render"), and it is brainstorm Stream 5 (#52 UI form schema, #54 command discovery, #55 dynamic form renderer SDK) landing on the machinery that has shipped since: the Personal Lens, the Edge engine, the Gateway trust boundary, and DDL self-description.

## 2. What already exists (grounding ledger)

| Piece | State | Facet's use |
|---|---|---|
| Personal Lens PL.1–5: `nats_subject` adapter → `lattice.sync.user.<id>`, SYNC stream, delta envelope `{op,key,anchor,kind,class,revision,projectionSeq,encrypted,data}`, Interest Set, `personal.hydrate`, D1 fail-closed `readableAnchors` gate, Vault ciphertext passthrough | ✅ shipped (`internal/refractor/adapter/natssubject.go`) | The world-feed. **No production lens is installed yet** — Facet's manifest lenses are the first. |
| Edge engine EDGE.1+2: bbolt mirror under Contract-#1 keys, LWW-by-revision, durable consumer, hydrate, optimistic overlay (`Pending` flag), durable intent queue + drain, `overlay.Links` "UI Discovery" | ✅ shipped (`internal/edge/*`, `cmd/edge`) | The app's data layer. Trusted posture today (`EDGE_ACTOR_KEY`); EDGE.3 gated on subscribe-ACL. |
| Gateway external door: `POST /v1/operations` (verify → strip → stamp verified actor), CORS, JWKS/dev-key, first-touch `ProvisionConsumerIdentity`, A→U resolution, revocation kill-switch | ✅ shipped (`internal/gateway/*`) | The only write path. |
| Contract #11 opaque binding + claim flow (Contract #9): `CreateUnclaimedIdentity` (client-minted secret, hash-only server-side), `ClaimIdentity` scope=self | ✅ shipped | Onboarding: fresh IdP login ⇒ bare A; claim ⇒ full U; the manifest re-projects and the world "blooms". |
| `cap.svc` availability join: `residesIn ∘ containedIn*0.. ← availableAt − unavailableAt`, fanned over `permitsOperation` → `serviceAccess[{service, resolvedVia, allowedOperations}]`; step-3 service path (`authContext.service`) | ✅ shipped (`packages/service-location/lenses.go:97`) — **zero topology seeded anywhere; not in any install chain** | The availability semantics Facet re-projects (richer columns, app-facing keys). The laundry example is literally this package's worked example (`ddls.go:98`). |
| DDL self-description: `.description` `.inputSchema` `.outputSchema` `.fieldDescription` `.examples` aspects, install-time mandatory (Story 5.1); Loupe's Submit-Op catalog proves they suffice for form rendering | ✅ shipped — but Core KV (Loupe-only read) and **per-DDL merged schema**, not per-op (`"required":[]` in most verticals; rbac/identity's per-op `oneOf` is the exception) | Source for the catalog lens; per-op schema is a vocabulary upgrade (§3.3). |
| Tasks: `vtx.task` root `{status,expiresAt}` + `forOperation/scopedTo/assignedTo|queuedFor` links; submit-bound-op-with-`authContext:{task,target}` ⇒ platform **auto-completes** in the same batch; `my-tasks` per-identity aggregate | ✅ shipped | The inbox. Facet uses the *designed* path (real identity + ephemeral grant + auto-complete) that today's staff-actor FEs bypass. |
| Per-identity NATS subscribe-ACL (auth callout; confines a connection to `lattice.sync.user.<U>` + its own durable + 3 `personal.*` RPCs) | ✅ SHIPPED (Fires 1–3, 2026-07-11/12; Fire 3 flipped EDGE.3) | Gate for any untrusted client on the sync plane (Fire 3 here depended on it — now clear). |
| whoami `GET /v1/actor` (client cannot compute its own opaque-derived ActorID) | ✅ SHIPPED (multi-credential Fire 2, 2026-07-11) | Required for `authContext.target` on scope=self ops and claim UX. |
| Consumer-invocable surface | 3 standing scope=self grants (ClaimIdentity, CreateAppointment, CreateLeaseApplication) + task-ephemeral ops; **no service-path op exists** | Honest v1 surface; Fire 1 adds the first service-path consumer op (`RequestService`). |

## 3. The world manifest (the data contract)

### 3.1 Delivery

The manifest is a set of **personal (`nats_subject`) lenses** authored by a new `packages/edge-manifest` package, delivered over the shipped SYNC plane and applied to the device mirror like any other Personal-Lens rows. Manifest row keys live in a reserved **`manifest.`** key namespace (they are projection-row keys, not Core-KV keys — same as `my-tasks.*` rows). The app renders by prefix: `manifest.me`, `manifest.svc.*`, `manifest.op.*`, `manifest.task.*`, `manifest.inst.*`.

Visibility is doubly guarded: the lens cypher only *derives* rows from the actor's own relationships, and the shipped D1 `readableAnchors` gate filters publication fail-closed. Neither is permission — submit-time step-3 remains the sole authority; the manifest only prevents the app from *offering* what would be denied.

### 3.2 The manifest lenses (semantic reference; as-built shapes in [docs/components/edge-manifest.md](../../docs/components/edge-manifest.md))

> **As-built amendment (Winston, 2026-07-16, post Fires 0–2).** The shipped rows keep these keys, fields, and semantics but **flatten the nesting** (`presentation.*`/`dispatch.*` → prefixed top-level columns; `template{…}` → `templateKey/Name/Icon`; `inputSchema` arrives as a JSON *string*) — the component doc + `packages/edge-manifest/lenses.go` are the normative as-built shapes; the JSON below is the semantic reference. The **`vocab` stamp is not yet projected**; it activates at the FORK-1 freeze trigger (second renderer), when the §3.3 evolution rules gain a reader. Fire 2 also added a **sixth lens this design missed** — `edgeManifestReadGrants`, producing `cap-read.edgeManifest.<actor>` slices (Contract #6 §6.14) without which the D1 fail-closed gate silently drops every non-self-anchored manifest row: §3.1's "doubly guarded" presumed a grant producer the design never specified. Named scope-downs (catalog = service-path reachability only; tasks = `assignedTo` only; anchors carry no labels) are recorded in the component doc.

All rows carry `"vocab": 1`. Keys shown with cosmetic ids; real ids are NanoIDs (Contract #1).

**`edgeIdentity` → `manifest.me`** — who am I, and what grounds my world:

```json
{"identityKey":"vtx.identity.h7Qk…","displayName":"Riley Chen",
 "credential":{"claimed":true},
 "roles":[{"key":"vtx.role.r1","name":"consumer"}],
 "anchors":[{"key":"vtx.unit.u4B","type":"unit","relation":"residesIn",
             "label":"Unit 4B — Maple Court","container":"vtx.building.mc1"}],
 "vocab":1}
```

`displayName` projects the identity's name aspect when readable (sensitivity rules apply; null for a bare unclaimed A — the renderer shows the "claim your identity" affordance exactly when `claimed:false` ∧ `anchors:[]`).

**`edgeServices` → `manifest.svc.<tplId>`** — one row per service template reachable via the actor's residence chain (the `cap.svc` walk, re-projected app-facing with presentation):

```json
{"serviceKey":"vtx.service.LNDR1","name":"Maple Laundry",
 "description":"Wash-and-fold, 24h turnaround","icon":"laundry","category":"home",
 "provider":{"key":"vtx.identity.pv1","name":"Maple Court Services"},
 "resolvedVia":[{"key":"vtx.building.mc1","label":"Maple Court"}],
 "operations":[{"operationType":"RequestService","opMetaKey":"vtx.meta.opRQ"}],
 "vocab":1}
```

**`edgeCatalog` → `manifest.op.<opMetaId>`** — one row per operation meta reachable by this actor (via `permitsOperation` on their services, standing role grants, or an open task's `forOperation`); the **operation descriptor**, deduplicated across services/tasks:

```json
{"opMetaKey":"vtx.meta.opRQ","operationType":"RequestService",
 "presentation":{"title":"Order laundry pickup","description":"Schedule a wash-and-fold pickup from your unit",
                 "icon":"basket","tone":"primary","submitLabel":"Place order","group":"laundry"},
 "inputSchema":{"type":"object","required":["pickupWindow","bags"],"properties":{
   "pickupWindow":{"type":"string","enum":["morning","afternoon","evening"],"title":"Pickup window"},
   "bags":{"type":"integer","minimum":1,"maximum":6,"title":"Bags"},
   "notes":{"type":"string","title":"Notes","maxLength":280}}},
 "fieldDescriptions":{"pickupWindow":"When we should collect from your door"},
 "dispatch":{"class":"service.laundry.instance","authContext":"service",
             "targetField":"service","contextParams":{"providedTo":"{actor}"},"reads":[]},
 "sensitive":false,"vocab":1}
```

**`edgeTasks` → `manifest.task.<taskId>`** — one row per open task `assignedTo` me or `queuedFor` a role I hold (per-row rather than the `my-tasks` aggregate, for delta-friendliness on the sync plane):

```json
{"taskKey":"vtx.task.t1","assignee":"vtx.identity.h7Qk…","queuedRole":null,
 "forOperation":"vtx.meta.opSGN","operationType":"SignLease",
 "title":"Sign your lease","scopedTo":"vtx.leaseapp.a1",
 "scopedToLabel":"Lease application — Unit 4B","expiresAt":"2026-09-01T00:00:00Z","vocab":1}
```

Renderer obligations inherited from §10.1 and the my-tasks corpus: treat `isDeleted:true` as absence, drop degenerate entries, and visually gate on `expiresAt` (an expired-open task can no longer authorize its op).

**`edgeInstances` → `manifest.inst.<instId>`** — my service instances ("my orders"): every `vtx.service.*` instance `providedTo` me, rendered generically from the template's presentation + the instance `outcome` aspect:

```json
{"instanceKey":"vtx.service.in9","template":{"key":"vtx.service.LNDR1","name":"Maple Laundry","icon":"laundry"},
 "status":"open","outcome":null,"createdAt":"2026-07-10T14:02:11Z","vocab":1}
```

This is deliberately the whole v1 domain-data story: service instances are already a *generic* cross-vertical shape (template/instance/providedTo/outcome), so "my orders" needs no per-vertical view descriptors. Vertical-specific slices (my lease, my appointments) join in Fire 5 as additional personal lenses + a small view-descriptor extension — a named non-goal for v1 (§8).

### 3.3 The descriptor vocabulary (#52 realized)

New **package-authored aspects**, projected by `edgeCatalog`/`edgeServices` (pkgmgr surface additions in Fire 1):

- **On op metas** (`pkgmgr.OpMetaSpec` grows optional fields → aspects):
  - `.presentation` `{title, shortLabel?, description?, icon, tone: primary|neutral|destructive, submitLabel?, group?}`
  - `.inputSchema` — **per-op** JSON Schema (today's per-DDL merged bag with `"required":[]` cannot drive a form; the rbac/identity per-op `oneOf` pattern becomes the projected norm)
  - `.dispatch` `{class, authContext: self|service|task, targetField?, contextParams?, reads?: [templates]}` — the machine-readable version of the loftspace `COMPLETIONS` registry. Template substitutions: `{actor}`, `{scopedTo}`, `{service}`, `{payload.<field>}` — this turns today's client-side hardcoded `reads` reconstruction into data.
- **On service templates**: `.presentation` `{name, description?, icon, category?}` (today a service root is `{}` — it has no name at all).

**Rules.** Icons and tones are semantic tokens from a small fixed set; the client owns all pixels. Descriptors declare *intent, not layout*. Evolution is additive-only: unknown fields are ignored, unknown icon → generic glyph, unknown widget kind → text input, rows with `vocab` above the client's supported version render with a graceful "update to use this" card. **Ops without descriptors still render, degraded** (title = prettified `operationType`, form = schema-less "not completable here" card linking staff to Loupe) — a package that never adopts the vocabulary degrades Facet, never breaks it.

### 3.4 Sensitive data

`vocab: 1` manifest rows are non-PII by construction (titles, schemas, keys, labels). Aspects classed sensitive keep arriving as `encrypted:true` deltas the app cannot read until EDGE.4 (`internal/edge/vault`) ships; forms *collecting* sensitive input (e.g. `RecordIdentityPII`) mark fields `sensitive` — masked entry, no local echo persisted, payload rides the TLS Gateway door like any op (processor-side handling: the shipped sensitive-param-egress mechanism).

## 4. The app

### 4.1 Bootstrap sequence

1. **OIDC login** (code + PKCE against the deployment IdP; Lattice never sees the login UI — Contract #11's boundary). Token refresh is the app's job; there is deliberately no OAuth code in the platform.
2. **whoami** `GET /v1/actor` → `{actorId, resolvedActorId, …}` (hard dependency; ratified, multi-credential Fire 2).
3. **Sync plane connect** — NATS (WebSocket in the browser) with the bearer JWT as the connect token → auth callout confines the connection to `lattice.sync.user.<U>` (+ its durable + `personal.*` RPCs).
4. **`personal.register`** (Interest Set) + **`personal.hydrate`** → deltas fill the mirror → `hydrationComplete` → UI composes from `manifest.*`.
5. Live thereafter: every graph change that survives the D1 gate lands as a delta; the UI recomposes. A service wired `availableAt` mid-session slides in; a revoked `permitsOperation` removes an action.

First-run with a fresh IdP account is the **claim beat**: first touch provisions bare A (`consumer` role, no anchors) → `manifest.me` shows `claimed:false` → the app offers "claim your identity" (QR/claim-link, secret in the URL fragment per Contract #9) → `ClaimIdentity` (scope=self, `authContext.target` = whoami's actorId) → the lens re-projects → the world blooms. That moment *is* the showcase.

### 4.2 Renderer

Screen archetypes (fixed): **Home** (anchors + services grid + tasks strip), **Service** (presentation + its operations + my instances of it), **Task** (bound-op form via the catalog descriptor), **Activity** (outbox + instances timeline), **Me** (identity, roles, credentials, claim/link entry — the multi-credential design's named FE consumer).

Widget vocabulary v1 (from `inputSchema` types + hints): text, textarea, integer/number, money, enum (segmented/select), date/datetime, toggle, entity-ref (picker over mirror rows of a named type), sensitive-masked. Form generation: per-op `inputSchema` drives fields; `fieldDescriptions` drive help text; `dispatch.contextParams` fields are auto-filled and hidden; `required`/bounds/enums validate client-side as courtesy — the Starlark script remains the enforcer.

### 4.3 Write path

Invoking an operation = authoring a Contract #2 envelope **from the descriptor**: `operationType` + `class` from `dispatch`, payload = user fields + `contextParams` substitutions, `reads`/`optionalReads` rendered from `dispatch.reads` templates, `authContext` per `dispatch.authContext` (`self` → `{target: actorId}`; `service` → `{service: serviceKey}`; `task` → `{task, target: scopedTo}`). Enqueue via the edge agent → drain submits through the Gateway (Bearer; the wire struct has no actor field; the Gateway stamps the verified actor). Task ops ride the **designed** path: real identity + ephemeral grant ⇒ the platform auto-completes the task in the same batch — no client-side `CompleteTask` workaround.

### 4.4 Offline & conflict UX (the "UI concern" the edge design left unowned — owned here)

- Optimistic overlay values render with a **provisional** treatment (R3: `Pending` flag ⇒ visible chip; retire only on the authoritative confirmed delta).
- The intent queue is a first-class **Outbox** surface (queued / submitting / confirmed / rejected), with an offline banner; drain-on-reconnect is engine behavior.
- `RevisionConflict` ⇒ engine re-hydrates; the app presents "the world moved — your change wasn't applied" with the refreshed truth and a re-do affordance (F7's presentation model, v1: no auto-retry, no merge).
- Revocation: Gateway writes die immediately (403 → sign-out flow); sync dies at authorization expiry (≤15 m). On confirmed revocation/sign-out the local mirror is purged (documented residual: host-level storage until purge).

### 4.5 Security posture (what the app is trusted with: nothing)

- Client holds only the IdP JWT; no Lattice-minted secret ever reaches the device.
- Visibility = D1 read grants (fail-closed) + lens derivation; permission = step-3 at submit. The renderer *reflects* both and *enforces* neither; hiding a button is UX, not security.
- Actor forgery impossible at three layers (no wire field, transport denial, Gateway stamp). `authContext` from manifest data only selects which grant is *checked*.
- Subscribe confinement = the ratified auth-callout ACL; bucket isolation = the ratified natsperm work. Facet never reads Core KV, never holds `ops.>` publish, never reads platform buckets.

## 5. Transport staging

| Stage | Transport | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — dev showcase (buildable now)** | `cmd/facet` Go host embeds `internal/edge` (trusted posture, `EDGE_ACTOR_KEY`), serves the PWA + a localhost UI feed; native NATS to the dev cell | none — EDGE.1/2 + seeded topology |
| **1 — real identities** | same, minus trusted posture: bearer JWT on connect, whoami, claim UX | subscribe-ACL Fires 1–3 (EDGE.3) + multi-credential Fire 2 |
| **2 — browser-native** | the PWA connects directly: **NATS's native WebSocket listener** (supported since server 2.2; our pin is 2.14 — enable in `deploy/nats-server.conf` with TLS + origin policy; auth callout applies at the connection layer, parity verified in-fire) — no bespoke bridge component | Fire 4 (small: config + natsperm vectors + parity tests) |
| **3 — pocket reality** | background wake: **push-waker** (WebPush for PWA; APNs when iOS lands) nudging the device to drain/hydrate | its own design (named deferred item — the only genuinely undesigned transport piece; PL.6's "WebSocket bridge" otherwise collapses into Stage 2) |

The corpus treats "Gateway WS/push bridge" as one unbuilt blob gating EDGE.5; grounding against the pinned vendor splits it: WebSocket is **native server capability** (config, not construction), and only the push-waker needs design. This materially shortens the road to a real browser client.

## 6. Gap register

| # | Gap (evidence) | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Packages cannot declare a `nats_subject` lens — `pkgmgr.LensSpec` accepts `nats-kv`/`postgres` only; the whole PL plane has **zero production lenses** (`internal/natsperm/conf_test.go:303` "latent") | **Fire 0** (lattice) |
| G2 | SYNC stream ships with no `MaxAge` (design says 24 h) — unbounded growth, hydrate-vs-replay trade unenforced (`adapter/natssubject.go ensureSyncStream`) | **Fire 0** |
| G3 | Edge engine has no change-notification hook — `overlay.Read` is pull-only; a UI host cannot react to deltas | **Fire 0** |
| G4 | Interest Set is static per run (no re-registration API on the engine) | **Fire 0** (passthrough), UI use v1.1 |
| G5 | No app-facing discovery projection: `cap.svc` is auth-plane, `allowedOperations` carries bare `operationType`, op metas carry only `data.operationType`, rich metadata is per-DDL in Core KV, and no op-meta→DDL link exists (mapping implicit via `permittedCommands`) | **Fire 1** — the `edgeCatalog`/`edgeServices` lenses + per-op schema convention |
| G6 | No presentation metadata anywhere: services have no name aspect; ops have no title/icon/tone | **Fire 1** — vocabulary aspects (§3.3) |
| G7 | Client-side dispatch knowledge is hardcoded (`COMPLETIONS`, client-built `reads`) | **Fire 1** — `.dispatch` descriptor |
| G8 | No consumer-invocable service-path op exists (`authContext.service` has zero users; `CreateServiceInstance` is operator-only) | **Fire 1** — `RequestService` (creates instance `providedTo` the actor) — the laundry-order op |
| G9 | Zero service topology seeded; `service-location` isn't in any install chain (no templates, no `availableAt`, no `residesIn`, empty `cap.svc` plane) | **Fire 1** — install-chain + `make seed-edge-demo` |
| G10 | whoami unbuilt (client can't compute its opaque ActorID → no `authContext.target`, no claim UX) | dependency: multi-credential **Fire 2** (ratified, queued) |
| G11 | Subscribe isolation unbuilt (any broker-reachable connection may SUB anyone's sync subject) | dependency: subscribe-ACL **Fires 1–3** (ratified, queued) |
| G12 | Browser transport: no WebSocket listener configured; auth-callout/WS parity unproven here | **Fire 4** (sharpened by §5 — config + vectors, not a bridge) |
| G13 | Background wake: no push story at all (FakeNotification only; recipient targeting blocked on the Vault-decrypt-at-send fork) | deferred, **named consumer = Facet Stage 3**; file as its own lattice design when Stage 2 lands |
| G14 | Sensitive aspects unreadable on device (EDGE.4 unbuilt) | sequenced behind EDGE.3 (existing edge design §7); v1 manifest avoids the need (§3.4) |
| G15 | Consumer write surface is thin (3 standing self grants; most vertical ops operator-only) | existing named Phase-3 tail; Facet is the demand driver — honest manifest meanwhile |
| G16 | `personal.{register,hydrate}` trust body `identityId` (verified-actor override designed in subscribe-ACL §3.4, unbuilt) | rides subscribe-ACL Fire 2/3 |
| G17 | Per-op availability overrides + temporal windows deferred (Contract #6 §6.10/§6.11, Andrew) | unchanged; manifest inherits service-level availability |

## 7. Decomposition for the Steward (fire-by-fire, each independently shippable + green)

- **Fire 0 `[lattice]` — PL consumer enablement.** `pkgmgr.LensSpec` grows the `nats_subject` fields (subjectPrefix/stream/personal/keys); `ensureSyncStream` sets the designed 24 h `MaxAge`; `internal/edge` exports a change-notification hook (overlay watch) + Interest re-registration passthrough. *Green:* a package-declared personal lens installs and streams e2e; stream info shows MaxAge; a host receives per-key change callbacks. *Depends on:* nothing.
- **Fire 1 `[lattice]` — the manifest package + vocabulary.** `packages/edge-manifest` (five lenses §3.2); `docs/components/edge-manifest.md` vocabulary spec (FORK-1 B); pkgmgr `OpMetaSpec` presentation/per-op-inputSchema/dispatch fields + service-template `.presentation`; `RequestService` consumer op (service path) in service-domain; service-location joins the install chain + `make seed-edge-demo` (laundry template, `availableAt` building, tenant `residesIn`, `permitsOperation`). *Green:* `verify-package-edge-manifest` + e2e — a seeded tenant receives all five row kinds over SYNC; `RequestService` submits under `authContext.service` and the instance row arrives; an undescribed op degrades per §3.3. *Depends on:* Fire 0.
- **Fire 2 `[verticals]` — Facet v0 (dev host + renderer).** Sally UX spec first (`facet-app-ux.md`); then `cmd/facet`: Go host embedding the engine (trusted posture) + PWA renderer v1 (Home/Service/Task/Activity/Me, widget vocabulary, outbox, R3 pending treatment, conflict presentation §4.4). *Green:* in-browser e2e on the seeded stack — hydrate → order laundry (form from schema) → pending→confirmed → task completes via descriptor form with auto-complete → row vanishes; kill NATS mid-session → outbox queues → reconnect drains. *Depends on:* Fire 1.
- **Fire 3 `[verticals]` 📋 READY — real auth turn-on.** OIDC PKCE login, whoami wiring, claim/link UX (Me screen), revocation UX; `EDGE_ACTOR_KEY` retired from Facet. *Green:* fresh IdP user → provisioned A → claim link → world blooms; revoked actor is cut per §4.4. *Depended on:* subscribe-ACL Fires 1–3 + multi-credential Fire 2 — both shipped 2026-07-11/12 (audited 2026-07-16, no longer gated).
- **Fire 4 — SUBSUMED by the ratified EDGE.5 plan** ([edge-browser-node-design.md](edge-browser-node-design.md) fires W1–W4, ALL `[lattice]` per Andrew's single-lane directive, 2026-07-16): W1 = the WS listener + natsperm vectors, W2 = the engine seams, W3 = the wasm/IndexedDB host + JS transport shell (FORK-2 as corrected by FORK-W A′), W4 = the Facet renderer swap carrying this fire's ratified green bar unchanged — the PWA on a second machine completes the Fire-2 e2e under confined WS permissions with no local binary. *Depends on:* W3 + Fire 3.
- **Fire 5 `[verticals]` — adoption + the second renderer.** Presentation aspects adopted across clinic/café/wellness consumer-shaped ops; a second domain slice (e.g. wellness booking via the service path); iOS/SwiftUI renderer spike over the identical manifest — triggers the FORK-1 freeze decision. *Green:* the acceptance demo — wire a brand-new service `availableAt` a building and watch it appear in both renderers with zero app change.

**Deferred, named:** push-waker design (G13, consumer = Stage 3) · EDGE.4 sensitive display · PL.6 multicast dedup (revisit when fan-out warrants) · vertical view-descriptors beyond service instances.

### 7.1 Fire 3 build note (Winston-ratified, 2026-07-16 — implementation shape, no fork)

Grounding turned up two things this line item's "OIDC PKCE login" language undersells:

- **The transport is already real, not trusted-posture.** `cmd/facet/main.go`'s own header comment: EDGE.3 (subscribe-ACL + Gateway-submit) is live, so the NATS connection and every Gateway write already ride a per-identity bearer JWT (`EDGE_TOKEN`) — there is no "trusted posture placeholder" left to retire. What Fire 3 actually turns on is the **identity lifecycle above that transport**: today `EDGE_IDENTITY_ID`/`EDGE_TOKEN` are minted *outside* the process (`make up-facet` shells out to `bin/gateway dev-token`) and injected as env vars before boot — there is no login/claim UX in the app at all, and literal OIDC PKCE has **no precedent anywhere in this codebase** (confirmed: no `oidc`/`oauth2`/`pkce` code outside a test-name string). Every deployed vertical (`loftspace-app`, `clinic-app`) stands in for "login" with the same **shared-dev-key JWT minter** (`readauth.go`'s `devSigner` + `POST /api/dev-token`), verify-only in production — that dual posture, not a real IdP, is the actual established, mirror-able pattern.
- **The claim ceremony is a raw-credential carve-out, already fully specified.** `packages/identity-domain/ddls.go`'s `ClaimIdentity` DDL: caller mints a throwaway device credential (any fresh `vtx.identity.<NanoID>`, never pre-provisioned), submits `ClaimIdentity{targetIdentityKey: U, claimKey: <secret>}` with `authContext.target` == that same throwaway credential (the self-scope gate), and the **target** U — not the caller — transitions unclaimed→claimed, gets the credentialBinding, and is granted `holdsRole→consumer`. `cmd/loftspace-app/web/app.js`'s `runClaimCeremony` is the exact wire shape mirrored below (`authContext: {target: aKey}`, `payload: {targetIdentityKey: uKey, claimKey: secret}`) — no `whoami`/`ProvisionConsumerIdentity` round trip is actually required to *submit* the claim (whoami matters for later session UX, not the ceremony itself).

**Decision:** Facet's browser talks to no one but its own Go host (`server.go`'s own invariant), so the claim ceremony is **one self-contained backend call**, not the multi-step client-orchestrated dance loftspace's SPA runs (loftspace exposes a Gateway URL to the browser directly; Facet deliberately does not). `POST /api/claim {targetIdentityKey, claimKey}`: the host mints its own throwaway device credential server-side (dev-key signer, gated `FACET_DEV_AUTH=1`, loopback-enforced — mirrors `readauth.go` verbatim, production posture is out of scope the same way loftspace's is), submits `ClaimIdentity` through the Gateway with it, returns the outcome. No `/api/dev-token` or `/api/whoami` surface is needed for this increment — exposing a general-purpose token mint would be a wider capability than the ceremony requires.

**What Fire 3 does NOT yet solve, named for the next increment:** `cmd/facet`'s engine (`sync.Manager`/NATS connection) is still bound to a single static identity chosen at process boot via env vars — nobody else needed this to change at runtime (`loftspace-app`/`clinic-app` are per-*request* multi-tenant; Facet is per-*process* single-tenant by design, offline-first). Making the *running* process re-point at a freshly-claimed identity post-claim is a genuinely new mechanism with no precedent to mirror — real design work, not execution — and is **not** attempted here. This fire ships the claim primitive (`/api/claim`, unit-tested + live-verified end-to-end below) as a real, verifiable increment; wiring it into a dynamic boot sequence + the Me-screen UX + revocation UX (§4.4) is the next checkpoint.

**Live-verified 2026-07-16** against the running dev stack (a throwaway `cmd/facet` instance on :7811, `FACET_DEV_AUTH=1`): `CreateUnclaimedIdentity` (admin) → `POST /api/claim` → target identity's `.state` flips `unclaimed`→`claimed`, `.credentialBinding` written (encrypted, `lastModifiedBy` = the freshly-minted throwaway credential), confirmed by direct KV read. **Found + fixed a real, currently-live environment gap while proving this**, not specific to Facet: the shared dev stack's Gateway system identity never had the documented one-time `identityProvisioner` role grant (`make provision-gateway-identity-provisioner`, added by the multi-credential design but apparently never run against this long-lived stack instance) — `gateway.go`'s `provisionActorIfNeeded` is a *tolerated, silent* best-effort no-op on failure ("the symptom is silent: the consumer identity just never appears"), so **every** first-touch self-service flow on this stack (LoftSpace Apply, Clinic self-book, not just Facet) was silently failing to auto-provision until this ran. Ran the documented idempotent fix; re-verified green.

### 7.2 Fire 3 course correction (Winston, 2026-07-16) — login restored to scope

A fidelity audit against this design (Andrew-prompted) found §7.1's increments quietly narrowing Fire 3 from the ratified "real auth turn-on — **OIDC PKCE login, whoami wiring**, claim/link UX, revocation UX" to "claim ceremony + revocation." The claim ceremony is not login: `ClaimIdentity` is one-shot (`unclaimed→claimed` only), so a returning user — or any second user whose identity is already claimed — has no way into the app; identity remains an operator-injected boot env var, and the thesis this app exists to showcase (§1: same binary, different identity ⇒ different app) has no delivery vehicle. §7.1's individual calls were each sound (no OIDC precedent; the shared-dev-key minter is the honest stand-in; a claim endpoint should not expose a general token mint) — but the one mirror-able piece of the precedent it cites, loftspace's **per-session identity selection**, is the piece that was not mirrored.

**Inc 2 — dev-login sessions (the restored leg; builds BEFORE the Me-screen/revocation UX, which becomes Inc 3 riding the session mechanism):**
- **Login surface:** `/login` per Loupe's shipped pattern (`cmd/loupe/readauth.go` — HttpOnly SameSite session cookie, token→cookie exchange, logout), with loftspace's multi-subject mint (`cmd/loftspace-app/readauth.go` `handleDevToken`): pick/enter an identity → the host mints its dev-key JWT (`FACET_DEV_AUTH=1`, loopback-only, same gate as `/api/claim`); plus a "new here? claim your identity" branch into the Inc-1 primitive. `GET /v1/actor` (whoami — shipped) wires the session's who-am-I UX.
- **Per-session engines** (the "dynamic boot" mechanism §7.1 named, driven by login rather than only claim): an identity-keyed, ref-counted engine map — per authenticated identity: own bbolt store under `FACET_STORE_DIR/<identity>.db` (warm resume), own NATS connection carrying that identity's token (the shipped auth callout already confines N such connections), own `sync.Manager` + agent + drain; per-session `deviceID` = a NanoID persisted in the session record; idle engines reaped (deregister interest, delete the durable). `/api/feed` + `/api/enqueue` bind to the **session's** engine — which also closes the audit's hardening find (unauthenticated `/api/enqueue` rides the boot identity; it additionally gains the non-loopback refusal `/api/claim` already has). Boot env `EDGE_IDENTITY_ID`/`EDGE_TOKEN` demotes to an optional single-user fallback.
- **Seed:** superseded by the **showcase dataset (§7.3)** — Inc 2's two-persona world loads from it rather than growing `seed-edge-demo` further.
- **Green bar (the demo beat this design exists for): two browsers, two sessions, two identities, simultaneously, from one host and one seeded topology — different Home/services/tasks; sign out and back in re-enters the same identity; the claim branch still blooms a fresh one.**
- **W4 forward-compat:** the login page + session model survive the EDGE.5 W4 renderer swap unchanged — W4 relocates the *engine* into the browser (token held by the in-page shell, per-browser store); the identity-selection surface stays. Named here so W4 does not re-litigate it.

**✅ Inc 2 SHIPPED (`0e46aa5`, 2026-07-16).** `cmd/facet/engine.go` extracts
the Fire 2/3 single-boot engine into a constructor; `enginemanager.go`
multiplexes one per identity, ref-counted by live SSE holders and idle-reaped
after 10m (the boot-env `EDGE_IDENTITY_ID` fallback, when set, is pinned —
never reaped, since there's no on-demand re-mint for its externally-supplied
token); `session.go` mirrors Loupe's HttpOnly/SameSite cookie generalized to
loftspace's any-subject dev minting (`/login`, `POST /api/dev-login`, `POST
/api/logout`, `GET /api/whoami`), falling back to the boot identity when no
cookie verifies — a deployment that never sets `FACET_DEV_AUTH` is
unaffected. `up-facet` now loads the showcase dataset (§7.3) and starts with
no boot identity at all. Live-verified against the running dev stack: two
cookie jars signed in as the two showcase tenants streamed distinct
`manifest.me/inst/svc` data concurrently from one process; logout + re-login
round-tripped back to the same identity; `/api/enqueue` 401s with no
session. `FACET_STORE_DIR` (one bbolt file per identity) supersedes the
single-file `EDGE_STORE_PATH`. **Deliberately out of scope for Inc 2:** a
signed-in identity's UI has no "who am I / sign out" affordance yet (whoami
exists server-side; Inc 3 wires it into the UI) and a second concurrent
session for the *same* identity reuses one engine/device rather than minting
a distinct device per browser tab — fine for the two-*different*-identities
green bar this fire proves, named here so Inc 3 doesn't re-litigate it.

**Inc 3 — Me-screen claim/link UX + revocation UX (§4.4)**, as §7.1 named, now session-scoped (build the sign-out affordance + whoami-driven header here).

**✅ Inc 3 SHIPPED (2026-07-17).** Me screen grows the claim card (a signed-in
but unclaimed identity submits the Inc-1 `/api/claim` primitive against its own
key), the whoami-driven header + sign-out affordance, and **manage sign-in
methods**: `cmd/facet/credentials.go` serves `GET /api/credentials` from the
already-shipped `identityCredentialsRead` Protected lens (no new lens — the
loftspace account-settings work `25623d9` created it; Facet adds only
`provision-facet-role` + `FACET_PG_DSN`, the same NON-superuser SELECT-only
posture, so RLS confines the row to the caller), and runs link/unlink as ONE
backend call each (`/api/credentials/link` submits Initiate as U then Complete
as a fresh throwaway A2 — loftspace's browser-direct dance would violate
Facet's "the browser talks to no one but this host" invariant). Live-verified:
link → the credential projects → **signing in with that new credential opens
U's world**; unlink → gone; removing the last one is refused by the platform
(`CredentialUnlinkRejected: last-credential`).

Four decisions this fire settled, recorded here rather than re-litigated:

1. **A linked credential must actually sign in.** Facet's session was the raw
   JWT subject, so signing in with a linked A2 opened A2's empty world while
   the Gateway resolved *writes* to U — a "sign-in method" that couldn't sign
   you in, i.e. §7.2's claim≠login substitution repeating. Login now resolves
   through **`GET /v1/actor` → `resolvedActorId`** (§4.1 step 2's named
   dependency, gap **G10** — this is its first Facet consumer) and mints the
   cookie for the resolved identity, so the engine's NATS connection and every
   write already authenticate as U. Deliberately NOT loftspace's
   credential-bindings KV read: §4.5 binds Facet to "never reads platform
   buckets"; the Gateway door is its only platform surface.
2. **Purge-on-sign-out vs Inc 2's warm resume** (§4.4 vs §7.2 — genuinely
   conflicting for this case, unreconciled until now): a reload/tab-close still
   resumes warm; an **explicit sign-out or a revocation purges** the bbolt
   mirror (`engineManager.Purge`). Inc 2's green bar is unaffected — re-entry
   re-hydrates instead of resuming, a latency property, not that bar.
3. **The revocation signal is the Gateway's 401/403, not an AuthDenied reply.**
   `internal/edge/agent.ErrCredentialRejected` types the door's refusal (a small
   fail-closed helper beside `auth.ErrTokenRevoked`); the intent stays queued so
   a re-login drains it. An `AuthDenied` *reply* is deliberately NOT treated as
   revocation — it is the routine capability-projection race `isTransientAuthLag`
   retries, and keying the banner off it defaced a session for a ~200ms lag.
4. **Purge forces engine eviction, which is what makes the sign-out flow
   recoverable.** An engine's credential is minted once and never refreshed, and
   `Acquire` returns the cached entry verbatim — so without eviction a
   revoked-or-expired engine is handed straight back to the user who just
   re-logged in, replaying the revocation forever (permanently, for a `pinned`
   boot engine). Adversarial review caught this as a routine T+30min lockout.

**Named residuals (not defects, not silently dropped):** the drain loop only
notices a dead credential when an intent is queued, so a revoked user who never
writes learns at the next write — §4.4 scopes revocation to "Gateway *writes*
die immediately", and the other half of that bullet ("sync dies at authorization
expiry ≤15m") still has **no UX**: the app shows Inc 2's "Reconnecting…" banner
indefinitely. That is the honest next tail. A failed `CompleteCredentialLink`
also leaves an orphan auto-provisioned A2 (the Gateway's first-touch pre-flight
creates it before the op is evaluated) and a dangling armed `linkKey` with no
TTL; both are harmless and retry-safe (re-initiating rotates the hash), and
loftspace's shipped path has the identical shape — a reaper is neither app's to
invent inline.

**Inc 4 — Fire-2 fidelity tail** (audit finds, all `cmd/facet/web`): the R3 pending-chip treatment is dead end-to-end (client never sends `touchedKey`; no render shows Pending — an edge-design R3 invariant, not a nicety); rejected-card Retry is unwired dead code; the offline banner keys on browser↔host SSE rather than host↔NATS state; confirmed outbox entries vanish instead of collapsing into history (UX §3.4); plus a regression test for "an undescribed op degrades" (§3.3's Fire-1 green-bar item, shipped untested).

### 7.3 Showcase dataset (Andrew-directed, 2026-07-16) — a curated demo world, not on-the-fly seeding

**✅ SHIPPED (`2696321`, 2026-07-16).** service-domain's family enum widened to
`{backgroundCheck, payment, laundry, fitness}` + a `RetireServiceTemplate` admin op;
`scripts/seed-showcase.go` (`make seed-showcase`) is the idempotent loader — fixed
NanoID handles, a building-anchored short-circuit so a rerun recovers instead of
re-minting. Live-verified: from-scratch load, idempotent rerun (zero ops on the
second run), and both live mislabeled `backgroundCheck`-as-"Maple Laundry" templates
confirmed tombstoned. One deviation from the plan below, decided during the build:
ops submit directly over NATS as the bootstrap admin actor (mirroring
`seed-edge-demo.go`'s own precedent), not through the Gateway — a dev/ops loader,
not a consumer-actor flow, so the Gateway's external-actor door doesn't apply. Tasks
(named below) were NOT seeded — the two-persona differentiation Inc 2's green bar
needs is already carried by differing service/instance state; a task seed is a
clean follow-up, not a blocker.

Andrew caught the graph lying: `seed-edge-demo` brands **`service.backgroundCheck.template`** vertices as "Maple Laundry" via `.presentation` (its own header documents the workaround — service-domain's `SERVICE_FAMILIES` enum is closed to `{backgroundCheck, payment}`, so the seed reused a permitted family). For a discovery showcase this is disqualifying: P7 makes the envelope class the machine truth, and it is *semantically live* — lease-signing's renewals lens matches `service.backgroundCheck.instance`, so a completed "laundry order" reads as a valid background check. The package is not buggy; the seed improvised around a deliberate constraint instead of extending it.

**The fix (one verticals-lane item, feeds Inc 2):**
- **Widen the taxonomy honestly:** service-domain adds the showcase families (`laundry`, `fitness` — what the dataset needs) to `SERVICE_FAMILIES` + the inputSchema enum + fieldDescriptions/examples + the out-of-enum rejection test. Verified safe: every class consumer either matches exact families (lease-signing) or is family-agnostic (cap.svc, edge-manifest lenses); `RequestService` derives the instance class from the template.
- **Curated dataset, loadable:** a checked-in declarative manifest (`deploy/showcase/world.yaml` or similar) — personas (two tenants sharing one building, differing roles/tasks), places, service templates with **correct families** + presentation, `availableAt`/`residesIn`/`permitsOperation` wiring, a task or two, an instance for the Activity timeline — applied by an idempotent loader (`make seed-showcase`): ordinary ops through the Gateway, deterministic handles so reloads converge, never direct KV (P2). `seed-edge-demo` shrinks to invoking it (or retires).
- **Cleanup:** the loader run (or a fresh world) retires the two mislabeled live templates (`vtx.service.LWFqbYGKUErL34AidEEk`, `vtx.service.UbwdojE6jBRQF31vwJjx`); nothing may keep presenting a family the class contradicts.
- **Deferred, named consumer:** a runtime **family registry** (families as data, validated against registrations rather than a package constant) waits for its real consumer — provider self-onboarding (the marketplace beat); until then the closed enum + honest extension is the simplest correct mechanism.

### 7.4 Fire 5 Inc 1 build note (Winston, 2026-07-17) — descriptor metadata on clinic-domain's consumer ops

Grounded Fire 5's "presentation aspects adopted across clinic/café/wellness consumer-shaped ops" before building: only ops with a `scope=self` permission grant are actually consumer-invocable (an edge/Facet client authenticates as one actor, never `operator`). Grepping every package's `permissions.go` for `Scope: "self"` found exactly three adopters — clinic-domain (`CreateAppointment`, `RescheduleAppointment`, `SetAppointmentStatus`), identity-domain, and lease-signing. **café-domain and wellness-domain have zero self-scope ops today** — every op is operator-only (POS / front-desk / staff-submitted) — so there is no consumer-shaped op to adopt presentation onto in either vertical yet; that is a precondition gap (a self-service booking/ordering surface), not something this fire builds or files as a blocker (no design decision needed — it is ordinary PO-filed demand, the vertical PO's normal rotation).

**Shipped (`cd8696d`):** `packages/clinic-domain/opmetas.go` — `OpMetaSpec` presentation/inputSchema/dispatch descriptors (§3.3 vocabulary) on the three clinic self-scope ops, mirroring service-domain's `RequestService` op-meta (the only prior adopter). `SetAppointmentStatus`'s op-meta narrows to the cancel-only slice a consumer can actually submit (`status` enum fixed to `["cancelled"]`) — the operator's broader status-transition surface needs no descriptor (the trusted admin tool calls the op directly, hardcoded). `Dispatch.AuthContext: "self"` is the design's already-specified-but-previously-unused enum value (`OpDispatchSpec` doc comment, `internal/pkgmgr/definition.go`) — using it is applying an existing spec, not inventing one. Verified: `go test ./packages/clinic-domain/...` green (incl. `TestPackage_ManifestMatchesDefinition` after syncing `manifest.yaml`'s new `opMetas:` block + version 0.18.0), `golangci-lint`, `lint-conventions` clean.

**Named residual, next increment:** adding these op-metas does not make the ops Facet-visible — `edgeCatalogSpec` (`packages/edge-manifest/lenses.go`) only reaches an op-meta via a service template's `permitsOperation` link, and clinic-domain has no service-domain integration. The next Fire 5 increment is the catalog-path wiring: a clinic service template (a `family` — the enum may need widening, §7.3 precedent), `availableAt` a clinic building, `permitsOperation`-linked to these three op-metas, seeded into the showcase dataset, then live-verified in Facet. This increment's worktree is merged + removed (per-fire convention — the next fire opens its own). café/wellness adoption + the second-renderer spike remain unstarted.

## 8. Non-goals (v1)

No local authority (EDGE.6 stays a separate Andrew-gated decision); no admin/cross-identity surfaces (Loupe exists; Facet renders only vocabulary-described personal projections — it is not a graph browser); no payments UX; no vendor push integration before the waker design; no per-vertical bespoke screens — a vertical that wants richer-than-vocabulary UI builds its own FE (the existing pattern) while Facet keeps the universal floor.

## 9. The throwaway demo

An interactive single-file mockup accompanies this design (Claude artifact, ephemeral by intent — <https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d7af37cd-dce1-47a3-83c5-dd1609a50356>): two personas over one "binary", a visible wire panel streaming the §3.2 frames verbatim, and the beats — login → hydrate → UI composes; order laundry (form generated from `inputSchema`) → outbox → confirmed → instance timeline; a mid-session `WireAvailableAt` sliding a new service in; a `permitsOperation` revoke removing an action; a task arriving, completed through its descriptor form; offline queue + drain; the claim beat. The frames in the demo are the row schemas above — the mockup is the manifest contract by example, not a separate truth.
