# Backlog — App Verticals (Stream 1)

Stream 1 = app-vertical packages + FEs (LoftSpace, Clinic). Advanced by the **Vertical Steward**; demand
filed by the **Vertical PO** (file-only). Index + cross-lane rules: [../backlog.md](../backlog.md).
**Row discipline** (one item = one row; State = token + ref + one-line next; detail lives in the design
doc + git, never narrated in the cell): see [lattice.md → How this board works](lattice.md).

**Scales.** Imp ★/★★/★★★ · Size XS–XL. **State.** 📋 ready · 🏗️ building · 📐 awaiting-Andrew ·
✅ ratified (designed, not built) · 🚧 blocked (`blocked-on:` / Andrew-gated).

## Vertical demand backlog (PO discovery)

Open items only — shipped demand is in the Done log. The PO files (tagged vertical + owner: FE = Sally +
FE Engineer · pkg = Package Designer · platform = component owner + Lattice lane); the Steward + FE
Engineer build. **No-paper-over:** a missing platform *primitive* routes to [lattice.md](lattice.md) and
the row is `🚧 blocked-on:` it (a missing *lens* is package work, built here).

| Item | What it is (PO view) | Vertical | Owner | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LoftSpace — per-landlord RLS view as the rich decision surface (D1.5 landlord cutover) | The protected `/api/landlord/applications` RLS read shows only a scope-count banner; the rich decision view is still the trusted-all-units console (§10.2). Project signals into `landlordLeaseApplicationsRead`, retiring the console. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★ | M | 🚧 blocked-on Vault · Rec C shipped ([design](../../implementation-artifacts/loftspace-d1.5-landlord-rls-decision-surface-design.md), `9b042f9`) · readiness/console/name-display deferred |
| Clinic — patient contact (email/phone) captured but never projected | `CreatePatient` stores `.demographics.{email,phone}` but the `clinicPatients` lens projects only `name` — staff can't see contact info, and a real reminder channel has no address to send to. | Clinic | pkg + FE | ★★ | S | 🚧 blocked-on Vault — `.demographics.{email,phone}` are PHI; `clinicPatients` is name-only by test-enforced discipline (the display half of lattice [Vault](lattice.md)); not a vertical-steward call |
| LoftSpace — applicant contact (email/phone) captured but never projected to the landlord | `CreateUnclaimedIdentity` stores `.email`/`.phone`, but neither the `/api/identities` picker nor the landlord `unit-applications` disposition surfaces them — a landlord deciding on an applicant has no way to contact them. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★ | S | 🚧 blocked-on Vault — `id.{email,phone}` are `sensitive=true` aspects; same display gate as the Clinic patient-contact row → lattice [Vault](lattice.md); not a vertical-steward call |

## PO notes (dated — drives rotation)

Compact rotation memory only — PO *findings* are filed as demand rows above + the Done log; the verbose
dated run-logs live in git history. Rotate LoftSpace ↔ Clinic, staggered from the Steward.

- **Rotation to date:** LoftSpace ×8, Clinic ×5 (last: LoftSpace 8th run 2026-07-01, reused the up shared stack; write-path was blocked stack-wide — see live-stack note; filed the vertical-app Health-KV self-report gap).
- **Method:** reuse the already-up shared stack (detect NATS :4222 / app :7788/:7799), drive the real flow via `/api/op` + the lens projections as the product owner, file scored items. Both apps exist + are exercisable live (`:7788` / `:7799`).
- **Live-stack note (2026-07-01):** loftspace-app's and clinic-app's admin actor is **unloaded** — `lattice.bootstrap.json` is `version:"13"` but `checkVersion` (committed `40f4d25`) requires `"14"`, so every `/api/op` write 400s "admin actor not loaded" on both apps (reads work; KV holds no exercisable data). Needs `make down && make up` to regenerate. Filed the underlying gap: [no vertical-app Health-KV self-report](lattice.md), so this class of failure stays invisible to Loupe next time. **Steward attempted the regen same-day (2026-07-01) and was denied** — the unattended sandbox's auto-mode classifier blocks `make down` outright as "interfere with workloads" (tears down the shared core stack), so this needs an attended `make down && make up` from Andrew's own session, or a policy exception for the Steward. Left 🔴 open.
- **Next:** Clinic (once the stack is regenerated so writes work again).
