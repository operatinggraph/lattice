# Backlog — App Verticals (Stream 1)

Stream 1 = app-vertical packages + FEs (LoftSpace, Clinic). Advanced by the **Vertical Steward**; demand
filed by the **Vertical PO** (file-only). Index + cross-lane rules: [../backlog.md](../backlog.md).
**Row discipline** (one item = one row; State = token + ref + one-line next; detail lives in the design
doc + git, never narrated in the cell): see [lattice.md → How this board works](lattice.md).

**Scales.** Imp ★/★★/★★★ · Size XS–XL. **State.** 📋 ready · 🏗️ building · 📐 awaiting-Andrew ·
✅ ratified (designed, not built) · 🚧 blocked (`blocked-on:` / Andrew-gated).

## Vertical demand backlog (PO discovery)

Open items only — shipped demand is in the Done log. The PO files (tagged vertical + owner: FE = Sally +
FE Engineer · pkg = Package Designer · platform = component owner + Lattice lane); the Steward + FE
Engineer build. **No-paper-over:** a missing platform *primitive* routes to [lattice.md](lattice.md) and
the row is `🚧 blocked-on:` it (a missing *lens* is package work, built here).

| Item | What it is (PO view) | Vertical | Owner | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LoftSpace — per-landlord RLS view as the rich decision surface (D1.5 landlord cutover) | The protected `/api/landlord/applications` RLS read shows only a scope-count banner; the rich decision view is still the trusted-all-units console (§10.2). Project signals into `landlordLeaseApplicationsRead`, retiring the console. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★ | M | 🚧 seq Vault Fire 5 (Vault 🎯 build-next in [lattice](lattice.md)) · Rec C shipped ([design](../../implementation-artifacts/loftspace-d1.5-landlord-rls-decision-surface-design.md)) · readiness clone = fallback if Vault stalls |
| Clinic — patient contact (email/phone) captured but never projected | `CreatePatient` stores `.demographics.{email,phone}` but the `clinicPatients` lens projects only `name` — staff can't see contact info, and a real reminder channel has no address to send to. | Clinic | pkg + FE | ★★ | S→M | 📋 re-model half ready NOW (patient `identifiedBy` unclaimed identity; contact → sensitive identity aspects) · display half 🚧 seq Vault Fire 5 · [plan](../../implementation-artifacts/vault-crypto-shredding-design.md) |
| LoftSpace — applicant contact (email/phone) captured but never projected to the landlord | `CreateUnclaimedIdentity` stores `.email`/`.phone`, but neither the `/api/identities` picker nor the landlord `unit-applications` disposition surfaces them — a landlord deciding on an applicant has no way to contact them. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★ | S | 🚧 seq Vault Fire 5 (Vault 🎯 build-next in [lattice](lattice.md)) — Fire-5 consumer: landlord protected lens gains contact columns ([plan](../../implementation-artifacts/vault-crypto-shredding-design.md)) |
| LoftSpace — ledger account shares the lease's own NanoID (Contract #1 violation) | `loftspace-ledger`'s `CreateAccount` mints the account under the lease's bare NanoID (mirrors clinic-ledger's pre-fix defect) — corrupts Refractor adjacency, so `ledgerHistory` silently projects 0 rows on the first real charge. Mirror clinic-ledger's fix: independent NanoID + a guard aspect on the leaseapp + a lookup lens. | LoftSpace | pkg + FE | ★★★ | M | 📋 ready · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/adjacency-shared-nanoid-collision-design.md) |
| LoftSpace — front-of-house unified search (people + units, FTS interim) | One staff/landlord search box: typed fan-out over the protected read models (identities; units/listings) in one RLS session; enrichment = keyed join to the lease-apps read model (active/signed ranked first); grouped clickable cards (People / Units) with related-agreement sub-rows. Consumes the ratified search design's blessed Postgres-FTS interim (`pg_trgm` indexes via `provision-readpath`; no platform work; consumer shape recorded in design §0a). | LoftSpace | FE + pkg | ★★ | M | 📋 ready (Andrew-directed 2026-07-02) · [shape](../../implementation-artifacts/search-target-adapter-design.md) · UX pass (Sally) first, then FE |
| Clinic — booking constraint as write-path slot claims (15-min grid) | Double-book enforcement moves off `kv.Links` read-enumeration to write-path per-slot claim keys (mirrors `appliedToUnit`); 15-min grid = package constraint (Andrew, 2026-07-02). | Clinic | pkg | ★★ | M | ✅ ratified · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/clinic-booking-write-path-slot-claims-design.md) |

## PO notes (dated — drives rotation)

Compact rotation memory only — PO *findings* are filed as demand rows above + the Done log; the verbose
dated run-logs live in git history. Rotate LoftSpace ↔ Clinic, staggered from the Steward.

- **Rotation to date:** LoftSpace ×9, Clinic ×6 (last: LoftSpace 9th run 2026-07-02, reused the shared stack; drove post-listing→apply→AssignUnitOwner live end-to-end; filed the post-listing missing-`manages`-link bug).
- **Method:** reuse the already-up shared stack (detect NATS :4222 / app :7788/:7799), drive the real flow via `/api/op` + the lens projections as the product owner, file scored items. Both apps exist + are exercisable live (`:7788` / `:7799`).
- **Live-stack note RESOLVED (2026-07-01):** the version-13→14 bootstrap mismatch is fixed; writes confirmed working on both apps.
- **Next:** Clinic.
