# Backlog — Lattice (Stream 2): features + component maintenance

Stream 2 = platform features + component maintenance. Pipeline: **Surveyor** files scored demand →
**Designer** turns items into design docs flagged for Andrew → **Lattice Steward** builds the ratified ones;
the **Whetstone** keeps CI fast cross-cutting. Written by the Lattice Steward + Surveyor (+ Whetstone CI rows,
+ PO-routed platform gaps) only. Index + cross-lane rules: [../backlog.md](../backlog.md).

## How this board works (read before editing — the row discipline)

**The board is an INDEX, not a journal.** One item = one row; the detail lives where the work lives.
A lint gate (`scripts/lint-board.go`, run in CI + before any board commit) enforces the budgets below —
**a fire that bloats a row or section fails the gate.**

- **A row is** `Item · What it is (one line) · Imp · Size · State` — **aim ≤ 300 chars, hard cap 600.** The
  **State** cell = a **token** + a **link to the design doc / commit** + (only if 🏗️) **one ≤10-word next
  step**. Nothing else.
- **The fire's narrative goes in the COMMIT MESSAGE + the design doc — NEVER the board** (the CLAUDE.md
  no-changelog rule). Do **not** put in a cell: design rationale / fork-resolution / "why I chose this",
  adversarial findings, the fire-by-fire journal, commit SHAs-with-prose, coverage %, review depth, "Was: …".
  A multi-fire checkpoint (worktree · done · next) lives in the **design doc**; the row carries a one-line
  pointer. **The four ways this regressed after the 2026-06-29 reform — refuse each by name:**
  - ✗ **Design summary in State** (*"steward impl-ratified the fork → package rolling-@at … @every stays
    reserved … Build: Inc 1 → Inc 2"*). ✓ `🏗️ building · [design](…) · next: Inc 1 series-state lens`.
  - ✗ **Blocked-reasoning essay** (*"blocked-on Vault because .demographics are PHI, test-enforced, clinic is
    the Vault forcing function, NOT ready as filed"*). ✓ `🚧 blocked-on Vault (PII projection) · [why](design)`.
  - ✗ **Survey-log / PO-notes fire-journal** (a multi-line narrative of what the fire did). ✓ one dated line:
    `2026-06-30 Refractor — healthy; filed 2 (simple-engine retire, fan-out cov)`. Narrative → the commit.
  - ✗ **Multi-sentence Done-log entry.** ✓ exactly one line: `date · SHA · [tag] title`.
- **Capped sections** (the lint enforces): **Survey-log / PO-notes ≤ 12 dated one-liners** — rotation memory
  only (what was surveyed/exercised, what's next), never a per-fire log; **Done-log ≤ 25 one-liners**, older
  roll to `archive/`. **Shipped (✅ built) items leave the feature tables** → a one-line Done-log entry.
- **Scales.** Imp: ★ low · ★★ medium · ★★★ high. Size: XS · S · M · L · XL.
- **State tokens.** 📋 ready · 🏗️ building (worktree) · 📐 awaiting-Andrew (design ratification) ·
  ✅ ratified (design signed off, not yet built) · 🚧 blocked (Andrew-gated, or `seq:`/`blocked-on:` another
  item) · 🎯 top-priority pick · 🗄️ shelved-backup · 🔭 flag-for-Andrew.

## Loupe → its own lane

Loupe (`cmd/loupe`) is advanced by **Stream 3** on its own board — **[loupe.md](loupe.md)** (the Loupe 2.0
console program + Loupe component maintenance; runs parallel to this stream, own build lock). Loupe rows no
longer live here; a platform primitive Loupe needs still files HERE per the cross-lane rules.

## Component maintenance

Open items only (shipped ones are in the Done log). Grouped by component tag.

| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[Loom] Guardless-step recovery check-before-act probe** | On total `loom-state` loss + a re-triggered `StartLoomPattern`, a fresh instance replays guards from cursor 0 (re-runs an already-applied guarded step). | ★ | S–M | 🗄️ shelved-backup (Andrew: no new engine Core-KV reads) |
| **[Refractor/Facet] Facet host health emission (`health.facet.<instance>`)** | A crash-looping per-user sync engine is FE-visible (syncDegraded frame) but invisible to the Lamplighter — `cmd/facet` holds no platform NATS credential by documented design (main.go "No Health-KV reporting": per-identity conns are natsauth-confined), so emission needs a trust-boundary call: host service credential vs Gateway-mediated vs stays-FE-only. Consumer: Lamplighter/health rollup. | ★★ | S–M | 📋 needs-design (Designer) |
| **[Refractor] Backfill the two protected lenses that ran without retraction** | `landlordUnitsRead` / `landlordLeaseApplicationsRead` never retracted until their adapter gained `ListKeys`, so their targets may hold rows no current projection produces (a landlord unassigned from a unit still reading it). The armed diff self-heals on each lens's next CDC event; an anchor that sees no further event stays stale until a truncate-rebuild. | ★★ | XS–S | 📋 ready · reconcile or confirm self-healed |
| **[Processor] A tombstone now retains the entity body** | Step 8 now preserves a tombstoned document's body. Callers passing `{"isDeleted":true,"data":{}}` to blank a body (`pkgmgr/upgrade.go`, `bootstrap/install_ddl.go:161,351`, `meta_ddl.go:71`) are no-ops — the parser discards a tombstone's document — so a dropped package entity keeps its `data` under `isDeleted:true`. No consumer depends on body-erasure; crypto-shred is the sanctioned eraser. Whether a tombstone may blank a body is Contract #3. | ★★ | S | 📋 needs-Andrew · posture call |
| **[Loom] e2e harness asserts `taskCreated` before the outbox relay lands** | `require.True(fp.taskCreated(key))` right after `waitTaskKey` races: `waitTaskKey` returns on the loom-state write-ahead token, before the relay publishes CreateTask and the fake processor records it (`onboarding_e2e_test.go:99`, `loom_e2e_test.go:386`); two tests observed failing under CPU load, both pass isolated. Fix: poll-until-created in the shared harness. | ★ | XS–S | 📋 ready |
| **[Packages] `demoOperator` inspect-only grant package** | Filed by Loupe F20.3. A demo identity holding read grants only (no package lifecycle, `ReviewProposal`, `ShredIdentityKey`, `RevokeActor`, vault decrypt, or op-submit) — mirror `packages/console-operator`, minus every write. This is the actual security boundary for exposing Loupe publicly; its own read-only mode is only defense in depth. Needed at the demo's public-launch phase. | ★★ | S–M | 📋 ready · [Loupe F20 design §3.1](../../implementation-artifacts/loupe-f20-demo-operator-ux.md) |
| **[Weaver] Lane-1 and the sweep can both credit one `__effect` close** | The sweep's `gapClosed` credit is revision-conditioned, but lane-1's `clearClosedMarks` delete is not, so a CDC delivery racing a sweep pass on the same closed gap credits alongside it. Over-credits one slot only when another episode of the same (target, gap, action) is concurrently pending — narrow, and in the safe direction, but it can mask one real mismatch. Fix = revision-condition lane-1's delete (its conflict must not Nak). | ★ | XS–S | 📋 ready |
| **[Weaver] Fresh-episode/reclaim error-branch coverage** | `fireEpisode`'s stale-mark reclaim path (NanoID-mint + `marks.replace` failures, 41.4% cov), `bumpDispatchCount`/`bumpEffectDispatch` failure-log branches (50%), `sweeper.deleteEffect` conflict/delete-failure (44.4%), and `reconcileConsumers` supervisor Add/UpdateSpec/Reset/Remove + health-sink-delete failure paths (62.7%) are the lowest-covered branches in an otherwise 86.8%-covered package (`internal/weaver/evaluator.go`, `reconciler.go`, `engine.go`). | ★ | S–M | 📋 ready |
| **[Bootstrap] `make up` pre-empts the freshness probe with the worse recovery** | With kernel processes up (`PROC_HEALTHY=1` — the recreated-containers case that recurred 3×), `make up` deletes `lattice.bootstrap.json` on a verify mismatch, so bootstrap mints **fresh** NanoIDs and orphans existing references; the binary's stable-id probe never fires. Reconcile the layers: distinguish an empty bucket (probe wins) from a real id mismatch (delete wins). Consumer: any stack recreated out-of-band under a live kernel. | ★★ | S | 📋 ready · `Makefile:151-163` |
| **[Bootstrap] `cmd/bootstrap` has no test files — the seed decision is inspection-only** | The probe, re-seed, and two-phase reopen are covered in `internal/bootstrap`, but the branch that *decides* to re-seed lives in `package main` and is untested. Consumer: the freshness probe's own decision path. Either extract the decision into `internal/bootstrap` or add a `cmd/bootstrap` test binary. | ★ | XS–S | 📋 ready · `cmd/bootstrap/main.go:110-140` |
| **[CI] `edge-browser-store` reds the gate on a slow headless-Chrome cold start** | `wasmbrowsertest` waits a chromedp-hardcoded 20s for Chrome's DevTools banner and exposes no knob for it (`test-edge-idb-conformance`). `-p 1` already removed self-contention, yet one cold start still overran on a loaded runner — observed on main, green on re-run, whole gate red meanwhile. Nothing retries the suite. Retry once on the `websocket url timeout reached` signature alone, so real failures stay unmasked. | ★★ | XS–S | 📋 ready |
| **[Weaver] Drain the `__effect` windows polluted before the attempt-booking fix** | Gating collapse-only reclaims stops new unanswerable episodes but cannot drain windows already filled. The live stack raises standing `LensEffectMismatch` on `leaseApplicationComplete` for `missing_onboarding`/`triggerLoom` and `missing_signature`/`assignTask`, each 20 pending slots deep, and they cannot self-clear (one close flips one slot). Needs a reset of the affected `__effect` keys, or a window-age bound so a stale window ages out. | ★★ | XS–S | 📋 ready |

### Survey log (round-robin rotation)

Rotation memory only — findings are the filed rows; fire narratives live in commits, never here.
Components: Core · Weaver · Loom · Refractor · Bootstrap · object-store-manager (+ the cross-cutting
feature backlog; Loupe moved to its own lane, [loupe.md](loupe.md)). Survey the stalest
(`git log -1 --format=%ct -- <path>`), note ONE dated line, rotate.

- 2026-07-02 Arch-review, all components — filed the intake section below; Refractor findings held for the post-update re-review; root-identity designation → Designer.

- 2026-07-18 Weaver (healthy, 86.8%/78.6%/91.3% cov, clean lint, no TODOs; filed error-branch-coverage + a doc-drift fix).
- 2026-07-18 Loom (healthy, 82.3%/80.2% cov, clean lint, no TODOs; prior deadline/redelivery gaps already shipped `495476b`; filed starlark-guard-sandbox-value-iface-uncovered).
- 2026-07-18 Refractor (healthy, build/lint clean; confirmed all 8 07-06-review findings already resolved in code — no new rows).
- 2026-07-19 object-store-manager (67.5%/91.4% cov, clean lint, no TODOs; filed doc-drift fix + cascade error-branch coverage).

## Arch-review intake — platform hardening & doc/contract truth

Open corrections from the [2026-07-02 full-platform review](../../../docs/reviews/arch-review-2026-07-02.md)
— per-finding `file:line` evidence and per-component verdicts live there; the What-cells here are abridged.
Refractor's deferred re-review is now filed as its own subsection below (2026-07-06).
Severity-ordered; same row discipline as component maintenance (shipped rows collapse to the Done log).

| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Refractor re-review (2026-07-06)

The deferred post-update re-review the 2026-07-02 pass held back — verdict **drifted** at the time; full
evidence in [arch-review-2026-07-06.md](../../../docs/reviews/arch-review-2026-07-06.md). **CLOSED** — the
2026-07-18 survey confirmed all 8 ranked corrections landed (`de4290b4`, `c5ed56b0`, `da8ee6cc` + the
Chronicler-host extraction and NKey-matrix grants), no open rows remain.

| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Weaver re-review (2026-07-06)

Scoped Weaver re-review — verdict **healthy** (best-conformed engine); full evidence in
[arch-review-2026-07-06-weaver.md](../../../docs/reviews/arch-review-2026-07-06-weaver.md). The W2 control
fail-closed fix, W3 validator-parity + heartbeat honesty, W4 targetId install-check, W1/W6 comment +
natsperm hygiene, and the W5 contract reconciliation shipped this session (Done log); these are the
deferred follow-ons.

## Lattice feature backlog — the Phase-3 build queue

The AI-driven flywheel draws from this list (Surveyor files → Designer designs → Steward builds the
ratified). Everything here needs design and is fair game **except** 🚧 Andrew-gated rows. Architectural
**forks** (Gateway, read-path auth, Vault, multi-cell, HA-NATS) and **frozen-contract** changes are
designed-through, but the *fork decision* + the *contract commit* are Andrew's.

> 🎯 **Build-ready now.** Every ✅ ratified row in the feature tables below is Andrew-gated or
> driver-blocked, so the live picks are the **📋 ready rows in Component maintenance** above. Top of that
> stack now: **[CI] `edge-browser-store` retry** (★★ XS–S), then **[Weaver] drain the polluted
> `__effect` windows** (★★ XS–S) and **[Bootstrap] `make up` pre-empts the freshness probe** (★★ S —
> the residual the probe left, filed with it). A stale callout starves the lane — whoever ships the top
> pick renames this to the next.

> 📐 **Awaiting Andrew — one contract edit staged uncommitted in `main`.**
> `docs/contracts/07-primordial-bootstrap.md` §7.4 makes `lattice.bootstrap.json` authoritative for the
> skip-seeding decision; `a44651f` makes **Core KV** the authority (the file stays authoritative for the
> *identity* of the set). The uncommitted diff is the proposal. Consumers: `cmd/bootstrap` only — no
> package or app reads §7.4 semantics. Ratify by committing it, or say the word and I'll revert.

### Security & trust boundary
| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NATS account-level write restriction | Close the fabricated-KV-write surface at the substrate (account-level); today defended only by overwrite-by-reprojection. | ★★ | M | ✅ effectively done · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/nats-account-write-restriction-design.md) §Fire-3-status · only deferred Fire 4 (prod mTLS) remains |
| **Keyed identity-index hashes (HMAC)** | Unkeyed `sha256NanoID` contact hashes are dictionary-testable with substrate access and persist in JetStream history post-shred; a Vault-keyed HMAC bounds it but needs a MAC primitive + key custody at every hash computer, and must migrate ALL index consumers (identityindex, provision probe, dedup) in one stroke. | ★ now / ★★ prod | M | 🗄️ shelved (revive: production threat model) · [analysis](../../implementation-artifacts/dedup-over-encrypted-pii-design.md) §9.1/§10-C |

### Scale-out
| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-cell / sharding | Graph scales by **cells** (root + subgraph co-located for atomic writes); global adjacency index + bridge links for cross-cell. | ★ now / ★★★ at scale | XL | ✅ ratified · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/multi-cell-sharding-design.md) · 🚧 seq (prod-scale driver) |
| **Global identity for a hyperscale tenant** | A hyperscale tenant (WeWork) spans cells/regions — cross-cell shadows + cross-region residency on top of multi-cell. | ★ now / ★★★ at hyperscale | L–XL | ✅ ratified (2026-07-16) · 🚧 Andrew-gated: DO NOT BUILD until further notice (does NOT auto-clear on multi-cell Fire 2 / a driver) · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/global-identity-hyperscale-tenant-design.md) |

### Edge & personal lenses
| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Personal / Secure Lens | Refractor projects a per-identity security-filtered subgraph stream; the Interest-Set watchlist; RLS-style link filtering. | ★★ | L | ✅ effectively done · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/personal-secure-lens-design.md) · Fires 1–5 shipped (D1 + Vault gates closed); PL.6 WS half subsumed by the ratified [EDGE.5 design](../../implementation-artifacts/edge-browser-node-design.md); multicast dedup stays deferred (bandwidth trigger) |
| Edge Lattice (full) | The sovereign per-user node: local VAL (SQLite/IndexedDB), local Starlark, offline-first, reconcile-by-revision. EDGE.1–3 (Go node, offline loop, untrusted security turn-on) shipped; EDGE.4–5 per the §7 gates. | ★★★ | XL | ✅ effectively done · [design §7](../../implementation-artifacts/edge-lattice-full-design.md) · EDGE.1–4 + EDGE.5 W1–W4 all shipped + tested · [EDGE.5 design](../../implementation-artifacts/edge-browser-node-design.md) · attended :9222 browser Gate-3 run = optional live demo, not a gate |

### AI-native
| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI-authored capabilities | A Lattice-aware agent proposes DDL/Starlark/lenses/workflows through human review + deterministic validation + rollback. | ★★–★★★ | L | ✅ effectively done · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/ai-authored-capabilities-design.md) · Fires 1–4 shipped (2026-07-16, `219fa0c`); Fire 5 (auto-apply) design-only per Andrew; Loupe UI is Stream 3's lane |
| **The Augur** (AI reasoning tier — L3 evaluator) | Weaver's AI-assisted reasoning tier for ambiguous/novel convergence gaps. The marquee AI-native feature. | ★★ | M–L | ✅ Fires 1+2a+2b shipped incl. §6 residual e2e (loop closes: escalate→review→dispatch) · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/augur-design.md) + [dispatch design](../../implementation-artifacts/augur-dispatch-pickup-design.md) · 🚧 Fire 3 autoApply Andrew-gated |
| **Weaver planner mandate (dispatcher → solver)** | Remediation stops being a static gap→action lookup: deterministic planner (per-gap candidate selection, then goal-regression synthesis over op-declared effects) with contraction/oscillation diagnostics and admission control; shadow mode + per-target cutover; the Augur stays the AI boundary. | ★★★ | XL | ✅ effectively done · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/weaver-planner-mandate-design.md) · Fires 1-9(Inc1)+R1-R3 shipped, consumed by LoftSpace renewals; Fire 9 AI tail deferred - needs a novel Augur gap, not renewals |

### Read-model / projection maturity
| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elasticsearch target adapter | A third lens target adapter (only NATS-KV + Postgres ship; no consumer yet). | ★ | M | ✅ ratified (2026-07-02, OpenSearch pin + FTS-first interim) · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/search-target-adapter-design.md) · shelf — FTS interim consumer SHIPPED (`b105cf5`); OpenSearch adapter itself still has no consumer |
| **[Refractor] Cross-instance projection-latency rollup** | Aggregate per-lens projection latency across Refractor instances into one per-component view (single-instance today, so per-instance == per-component). Link-tombstone re-projection half **subsumed** by the link-aspect reprojection design. | ★ | S | 🚧 seq behind HA-NATS multi-instance · [link-aspect design](../../implementation-artifacts/link-aspect-triggered-reprojection-plain-lenses-design.md) subsumes the tombstone half; no multi-instance consumer yet |

### Refinements & ops
| Item | What it is | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CI pipeline speed (continuous)** | Make CI faster without weakening any gate — owned continuously by the **Whetstone**. Matrix split done (serial → 4 parallel jobs); convergence + unit parallelized; unit itself now sharded across 2 runners. | ★★ | M (ongoing) | 🏗️ continuous (Whetstone) · aggregate-CPU ceiling confirmed 2x, isolating natsperm into its own step reconfirmed it (Done log) · next: propose paid larger runners to Andrew |
| **Hard-delete mutation verb (true link/aspect keyspace reclaim)** | Mutation vocab is create/update/tombstone (soft PUTs); a tombstoned key persists + is still enumerated by `kv.Links`. A 4th `delete` verb (NATS `DEL`) lets dead links leave the keyspace, bounding `kv.Links` LIST cost. | ★ | M | 🗄️ shelved (Andrew 2026-07-02) · [design + hold banner](../../implementation-artifacts/hard-delete-mutation-verb-design.md) · demand dissolved by clinic write-path slot claims; §3 edits reverted; revive only on a real reclaim driver |
| **Script-read posture — declared+hydrated vs live `kv.get`/`kv.Links`** | Declared+hydrated reads as the write-path norm: `optionalReads` folds read-before-create in; `kv.Links` declared-as-metadata (Edge-gate + best-effort lint, not hydrated); guards become a generic Processor-side operation feature (supersedes Loom's engine read). | ★★ | L | ✅ Fires 1–2 shipped · [design §12](../../implementation-artifacts/script-read-posture-design.md) · Fire 3 (guards) deferred to its first consumer; debt sweep + warn→block flip SHIPPED `63aab49` |

### Parking lot — very low priority (far, far back)

Real but low-value; do **not** spend design or build effort here unless Andrew greenlights one.

| Item | Why it's parked | Imp | Size | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Expose the authorizer's resolved roles to op scripts (`op.actorRoles`)** | Step 3 resolves the actor's roles from the cap doc but scripts cannot see them, so an op asking "is my caller root" re-derives it by walking `holdsRole` — a re-derivation that can disagree with what step 3 authorized, plus a `kv.Links` round trip per op. | ★★ | S | 📋 ready · consumer: the staff workplace guards ([staff-worlds F4](../../implementation-artifacts/facet-staff-worlds-design.md)) |
| **Historical state query (FR51)** | Operators query historical state across a time range (audit/ledger + point-in-time reconstruction). Low near-term value + standing storage cost; builds to reserved contract seams. | ★ now / ★★ if real need | M→L | ✅ ratified (design) · [design](../../implementation-artifacts/historical-state-query-design.md) · build deferred (Andrew, revive on a concrete need); archive layers re-home to the Chronicler |
| multi-aspect atomic OCC for `UpdateMetaVertex` | `meta_ddl.go` applies `expectedRevision` to the first changed aspect by design; true multi-key OCC needs a substrate per-key-revision primitive — marginal value. | ★ | M+ | 🗄️ parked |
| freshnessExpiry marker tombstone-on-convergence | A converged marker is read by nothing and harmless; tombstoning buys cleanup not correctness. | ★ | S | 🗄️ parked |
| production freshness-window tuning | A staleness-tolerance vs. timer-churn value judgment — Andrew's call if/when it matters. | ★ | XS | 🗄️ parked |
